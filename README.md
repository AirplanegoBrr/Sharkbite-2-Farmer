# Why?
- Was Made to farm teeth because I'm too lazy!
- And because the Developer added an "AFK Detection Algorithm".

# Features:
- Clicks Multiple Different Things. Mainly to-do with the AFK-Detection Algorithm.
- The Newest ***(V3-Script)*** is 78% faster, and 136% more Efficient than the ***(V2-Script)***.
- Compiled Version to ***Work*** on Machines that do NOT have Python Installed.

# Notes:
