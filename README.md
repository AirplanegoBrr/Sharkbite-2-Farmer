# Why?
- Was Made to farm teeth because I'm too lazy!
- And because the Developer added an AFK Detection Algorithm.

# Features:
- Clicks Multiple Different Things. Mainly to-do with the AFK-Detection Algorithm.
- The Newest ***(V3-Script)*** is 78% faster, and 136% more Efficient than ***(V2-Script)***

# Notes:
- This is ***NOT*** a hack-script. It does ***NOT*** modify the game in any capacity.
- Newest Version ***V3-Script*** Completely Revamps the Original One.
