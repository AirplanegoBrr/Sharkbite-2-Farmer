# Sharkbit-2-Anti-AFK-Detector
- Made to farm teeth because I'm too lazy!

# Features:
- Spins the player around when they're a survivpr (stops the game from detecting you as afk ***Also Turning Doesn't count as driving, so the shark can't see you as easily.***).
- If you're chosen as the shark, the script will attempt to use the "Speed" special, and move around.

# Notice:
- This is ***NOT*** a hack-script. It does ***NOT*** modify the game in any capacity.
