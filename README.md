# Why?
- Made to farm teeth because I'm too lazy!
- And because the Developer added an AFK Detection Algorithm.

# Features:
- Spins the player around when they're a survivor. And stops the game from detecting you as being AFK.
- Turning Doesn't count as driving, so the shark can't see you as easily. (The game counts it as being active).
- If you're chosen as the shark, the script will attempt to use the "Speed" special, and move around.

# Notice:
- This is ***NOT*** a hack-script. It does ***NOT*** modify the game in any capacity.
